## **1. Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive review of the current e-commerce leadership and operational structure within _The Wynwood Walls Shop_, with specific focus on the role and performance of **Alejandro Trujillo**, E-Commerce Director.

The findings highlight Alejandro’s strong technical commitment and operational contribution in maintaining the day-to-day e-commerce ecosystem. However, his current management style and capabilities align more closely with a **digital operations or marketing coordinator** role than with that of a strategic director.

While he brings genuine dedication and technical skill, the role’s demands for growth strategy, structured marketing leadership, and scalable process management exceed his current bandwidth. Strengthening the framework around him would help facilitate greater efficiency and long-term growth.

## **2. Role Overview**

Alejandro currently oversees all digital commerce activity for _The Wynwood Walls Shop_, including:

- Shopify platform management and product onboarding
- Inventory synchronization (Lightspeed → Mortar → Shopify)
- Google Ads management (Search, Performance Max, Shopping)
- SEO optimization and product metadata updates
- Mailchimp campaign execution and list management
- Analytics (GA4, Tag Manager, Search Console)
- Coordination with internal creatives and external vendors

In practice, Alejandro functions as both **operator and technician**, ensuring the digital infrastructure runs smoothly. Many of the shop’s internal systems were built by him, and he retains manual control over nearly every workflow connected to products, marketing, and analytics.

## **3. Day-to-Day Responsibilities**

| Functional Area             | Key Activities                                                                                                        | Notes                                                                                                  |

| **SEO**                     | Conducts keyword research and metadata updates.                                                                       | Lacks broader strategy for content hierarchy or internal linking.                                      |

## **4. Strengths**

✅ **Technical Proficiency** – Solid command of Shopify, Lightspeed, and related systems; working knowledge of Google and Meta Ads.

## **5. Gaps and Limitations**

**Strategic Growth Skills**
An effective executor but not yet fluent in strategic marketing concepts such as funnel design, audience segmentation, or growth modeling. Lacks a documented roadmap for scaling performance.

**Campaign Management**
Campaigns are fragmented, overlapping, and misaligned with the buyer journey. The current structure inflates ROAS and obscures true acquisition costs.

**Analytical Insight**
Uses analytical tools but does not translate findings into actionable direction. Decisions rely more on instinct than data interpretation.

**Delegation & Leadership**
Handles nearly every task personally. Absence of SOPs or delegation prevents scalability and creates dependency on one person.

**Cross-Department Collaboration**
Limited coordination with creative and marketing teams, which weakens integration between technical execution and brand storytelling.

**Operational Focus**
Split responsibilities across multiple entities (shop, museum, gallery) dilute attention from the shop’s core e-commerce goals.

**Brand Positioning**
Missing the focus on the brand's positioning in the market, and the opportunity to tell a story rather than just sell products.

## **6. Functional Level Assessment**

Although titled **E-Commerce Director**, Alejandro’s current performance aligns more closely with that of a **Digital Commerce Manager** or **Marketing Operations Coordinator**.
He demonstrates deep technical ownership but lacks the strategic fluency and leadership leverage typically required of a director-level position.

**Functional Competency Summary**

- **Platform Management — 5/5:** Excellent execution; system stability relies heavily on his hands-on management.
- **Campaign Management — 2/5:** Disorganized structure, limited testing, and under-optimized targeting.
- **Strategic Planning — 2/5:** Operates reactively; no documented growth roadmap or campaign hierarchy.
- **Brand & Marketing Understanding — 2/5:** Views e-commerce as transactional, not experiential.

## **7. Analytical Conclusion**

Alejandro is a highly dedicated and technically capable **digital operations professional** whose attention to detail keeps the online business running reliably. His consistency and problem-solving mindset are significant assets.

However, the role currently places both strategic and operational expectations on a single individual, which is neither scalable nor sustainable. Alejandro’s effectiveness could be greatly enhanced by a framework that clearly separates **strategy**, **execution**, and **creative development**, supported by appropriate processes and communication structures.

**Key Development Priorities:**

1. **Strategic Marketing Depth** – Expand knowledge of funnel marketing and campaign sequencing.
2. **Systemization & Delegation** – Implement SOPs and delegate routine workflows.
3. **Focus & Scope** – Concentrate exclusively on e-commerce growth levers.
4. **Cross-Team Integration** – Strengthen collaboration with creative and brand teams.
5. **Knowledge Documentation** – Capture and formalize internal workflows to ensure continuity and scalability.

## **8. Final Assessment & Closing Reflection**

Alejandro is a valuable contributor whose commitment and technical expertise underpin the shop’s digital stability. The next stage of success for the e-commerce division depends on evolving the structure around him—not replacing it.

With clear strategic oversight to define objectives, SOPs and automation to streamline operations, and targeted support for campaign management, the shop can shift from maintenance mode to measurable growth.
This structure would allow Alejandro to move from reactive execution to proactive optimization, channeling his skill set into higher-impact areas.

Most challenges identified—tracking gaps, overlapping campaigns, and reactive marketing cycles—are operational, not personal. They can be resolved through defined roles, better collaboration, and shared accountability.

By introducing clarity and process discipline, _The Wynwood Walls Shop_ can fully leverage Alejandro’s strengths within a scalable, data-driven, and creative digital ecosystem.
