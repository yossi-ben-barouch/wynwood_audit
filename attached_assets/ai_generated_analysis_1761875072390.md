# Wynwood Walls E-Commerce & Digital Marketing Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes three comprehensive meeting transcripts involving the Wynwood Walls team, focusing on e-commerce operations, digital marketing strategy, and organizational challenges. The analysis reveals a business with strong foundational assets (high domain authority, quality products, significant foot traffic) but facing execution and coordination challenges that are limiting online revenue growth.

**Key Finding**: The shop's online sales are underperforming despite having world-class assets, primarily due to fragmented marketing efforts, resource constraints, and misalignment between product development and digital marketing strategies.

---

## 2. CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT

### Digital Infrastructure

#### Platforms in Use

- **Primary POS**: Lightspeed (95% of sales are on-site)
- **E-Commerce**: Shopify (migrated ~3 years ago)

- **Gallery**: Art Cloud
- **Email**: Mailchimp (400,000 contact ceiling, $2,500/month enterprise)
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics, SEMrush ($350/month)

#### Website Ecosystem

1. **Shop.wynwoodwalls.com** - E-commerce platform
2. **Wynwoodwalls.com** - Museum/attraction site
3. **Gallery site** - Art sales
4. **Goldman Properties** - Corporate site

**Critical Issue**: All sites were using shared Google Ads account until recently, causing museum searches to drain shop advertising budget. Recently separated but lost remarketing synergy.

### Traffic & Conversion Metrics

#### Museum Website

- **250,000 visitors/month**
- High potential for conversion to shop, events, groups
- Currently underutilized for product promotion

#### Shop Performance

- **2-3 years of operation**
- **200% growth Year 1**
- **Similar growth Year 2**
- **Current year: 10% decline** (attributed to tariffs, supplier closures)
- **Conversion rate**: Under 1% (improved after account separation)
- **Social following**: 8,000 followers (shop Instagram - very low)

#### Revenue Sources (Shop)

1. **Google Ads** (primary channel) - 33% growth after isolation
2. **Direct traffic** (artist collaborations)
3. **Organic search** (strong SEO rankings)
4. **Social media** (~$10,000 growth YoY, but still minimal)
5. **Amazon** (~$6,000/month from books before restrictions)

### Product Mix Analysis

#### Inventory Composition

- **2,500 SKUs total**
- **40% internally produced**
- **60% sourced from suppliers**

#### Categories

1. **Third-party collectibles** (Super Plastic, Bear Bricks, Kidrobot)
   - 50-60% margins
   - Strongest SEO performers
   - Currently losing suppliers (Super Plastic closed)
2. **Artist-designed products**

   - Books, notebooks, apparel, accessories
   - Higher margins but lower recognition
   - Limited quantities (collectible nature)

3. **Stationery/Small goods**
   - Stickers, magnets, keychains
   - Low margins, high competition
   - Difficult to advertise profitably ($3-4 CPC)

#### Supplier Relationships

- **15 production categories** across Vietnam, Asia, Portugal, local
- **Purchase agreements** restrict Amazon sales for some products
- **Small batch production** due to uncertain demand
- **3-month production cycle** from concept to shelf

### Marketing Performance

#### Google Ads

- **Previous budget**: ~$1,800/month (mixed with museum)
- **Current budget**: ~$3,000/month (shop only)
- **ROAS**: 2X on some campaigns after isolation
- **Structure**: Mix of Performance Max, Shopping, Search campaigns
- **Issue**: Promoting museum instead of products before separation

#### Meta/Facebook Ads

- **Budget**: ~$900/month
- **Recent changes**: Account verification, better targeting
- **Performance**: Growing but still underperforming
- **Issue**: Generic campaigns, not product-specific

- **List size**: 350,000-400,000 (at ceiling)
- **Cost**: $2,500/month + $1,000 consultant fee
- **Frequency**: Monthly sends
- **Problem**: No sales conversion, stagnant engagement
- **Recent action**: Scrubbing non-engaged subscribers

#### SEO Performance

- **Domain Authority**: 47 (SEMrush), 72 (Ahrefs)
- **Ranking**: #1-2 for multiple collectible brands
- **Issue**: Ranking for products no longer in stock
- **Opportunity**: 250K/month museum site traffic untapped

#### Social Media

- **Instagram**: 6,500 followers (shop), 100,000+ (museum)
- **TikTok**: Barely touched, huge opportunity
- **Strategy**: Promotion-heavy, lacking storytelling
- **Missing**: Live shopping, influencer collaboration, UGC

## 3. CRITICAL PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED

### 3.1 Resource Allocation Crisis

**Alejandro's Workload**:

- Managing 4 separate websites
- Google Ads across multiple businesses
- Product data entry and optimization (2,500 SKUs)
- SEO for all properties
- Technical support for museum, gallery, corporate sites
- Amazon marketplace management
- Social media bot management
- Email automation

**Result**: Core e-commerce responsibilities (driving shop sales) diluted by peripheral duties.

**Quote**: _"I got so many clicks, I have so many impressions, I have so many costs that it's not easy to track every single one."_

### 3.2 Disconnected Marketing & E-Commerce

**Symptoms**:

- Marketing creates campaigns without e-commerce input
- Product launches happen without marketing preparation
- No standardized product launch SOP
- Social media operates independently of shop priorities
- Email campaigns lack strategic product focus

**Example**: Marketing wanted to change website theme based on aesthetics, not conversion data or user behavior analysis.

### 3.3 Inventory & Product Strategy Misalignment

**Core Issue**: Products designed for retail, not e-commerce

- Pricing uncompetitive online vs. in-store experience
- No clear differentiation strategy
- Margins too thin for aggressive digital advertising
- Limited quantities prevent sustained SEO investment

**Quote from Daniel**: _"None of these products were created for e-commerce. These products were created for in-store."_

### 3.4 Data Fragmentation

**Multiple systems not talking to each other**:

- Lightspeed (inventory master)
- Shopify (online sales)
- Amazon (separate manual management)
- Google Ads (multiple accounts)
- Mailchimp (separate audiences)
- No unified customer view

### 3.5 Missed Opportunities

1. **Museum traffic not monetized**: 250K monthly visitors see no shop integration
2. **Artist pages rank #1-2**: No product showcasing on these pages
3. **OTA success not replicated**: Museum OTAs growing from $2K to $10K/month, but no equivalent for shop
4. **No multichannel presence**: Missing Etsy, limited Amazon, no TikTok Shop
5. **Abandoned cart recovery**: Basic automation only
6. **No upsells/cross-sells**: Minimal product recommendations
7. **Event/group traffic**: Huge potential (private events $50-75K each) not pursued digitally

---

## 4. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING ANALYSIS

### Strengths

1. **World-class street art brand** with cultural authority
2. **High domain authority** (DA 47-72 depending on tool)
3. **Exclusive artist relationships**
4. **Physical destination**: tourists + 3M local residents
5. **Unique product positioning**: Collectible art, not commodities
6. **Strong organic rankings** for collectible brands

### Weaknesses

1. **Premium pricing** without premium positioning online
2. **No cohesive brand story** in digital marketing
3. **Fragmented customer journey** across platforms
4. **Minimal social proof** (low review count, 6.5K followers)

### Opportunities

1. **Content authority**: Position as "street art authority" through blog
2. **Artist storytelling**: Leverage artist collaborations for engagement
3. **YouTube presence**: Zero activity on fastest-growing platform
4. **Live shopping**: TikTok, Instagram capabilities unused
5. **Subscription boxes**: Monthly artist product deliveries
6. **Marketplace expansion**: Etsy perfect fit for unique art products, eBay for collectibles and extra exposure.

### Threats

1. **Supplier instability**: SuperPlastic closure, Asulin books restrictions
2. **Tariff impacts**: Product costs increasing
3. **Free street art**: Neighborhood murals competing with paid museum
4. **Talent retention**: Multiple marketing personal turnover, One-person e-commerce department unsustainable
5. **Budget constraints**: Limited ability to scale with uncertain ROI

## 5. TECHNICAL AUDIT FINDINGS

### Google Ads Structure Issues

**Current Problems**:

- Only 4-5 campaigns (should be 200+ ad groups for more precise control while building conversion history and targeting pixel)
- Using Performance Max (should be Google Shopping with Pmax remarketing)
- Search campaigns for remarketing (should be opposite)
- No granular product-level campaigns
- Broad match keywords draining budget

**Specific Example**:

- Ranking #1 for "Super Plastic" but no inventory
- Paying for clicks that can't convert
- "Stickers" keyword: $4 CPC, can't compete with margins

### Data Feed Optimization

**Current State**:

- Using default Shopify product titles for all channels
- No channel-specific optimization (Amazon, Google, Etsy)
- No custom title structure with keyword stacking
- Missing schema markup for rich snippets

**Recommendation**: Custom fields for each channel, allowing granular control:

### Website Conversion Issues

**Identified Problems**:

1. No upsells at cart
2. No cross-sells on product pages
3. Limited product recommendations
4. No urgency/scarcity messaging
5. Missing social proof elements
6. No gamification (free shipping thresholds, etc.)
7. Artist information not prominent

### Automation Gaps

**Current Manual Processes**:

- Product data entry (one-by-one)
- SEO optimization per product
- Google Ads keyword research
- Amazon listing creation
- Price monitoring vs. competitors

**Opportunity**: Implement Alejandro's custom prompts using automations to speed up product data creation and replace manual entry focusing on final review instead of writing.

   - "Complete Guide to [Artist Name]"
   - "Street Art Styles: Graffiti vs. Muralism vs. Stencil"

4. **Blog Publishing Cadence**
   - 2-3 posts per week (outsource to writers)
   - Alejandro reviews for accuracy, not writes
   - Nicole provides creative direction
   - Photographer provides imagery

**Expected Impact**:

- 50-100% increase in organic traffic within 90 days
- Higher engagement time (reduces bounce rate)
- Natural link building from art community
- Multiple entry points for different customer searches

   - Use WiFi login to tag museum visitors and build retargeting audiences
   - Google Ads remarketing: Show product ads to museum site visitors
   - Meta/Facebook pixel: Retarget museum visitors with shop products

   - Target for spray painting sessions, artist classes, group events
   - Retargeting ads: Show activity promotions only to Miami-based previous visitors
   - Geo-targeted campaigns: 25-mile radius for spray painting/classes

   **Shop Customers → Museum Experiences**:

   - Product buyers: Museum ticket discount code via email
   - Artist collection buyers: Alert when that artist is featured or teaching
   - High-value customers: Private tour invitations, VIP events
   - Retargeting: Show museum/activity ads to shop customers

   **Technical Implementation**:

## 11. CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### What Must Go Right

1. **Leadership Buy-In**

   - Scott and Justin must support investment in team/tools
   - Jessica must embrace multichannel strategy (Etsy, TikTok, etc.)
   - Trust Alejandro and Yossi's technical recommendations
   - Commit to 6-12 month timeframe for results

2. **Resource Allocation**

   - Free Alejandro from non-shop responsibilities (75%+ time on shop)
   - Hire VA team within 30 days
   - Hire Digital Marketing Manager within 90 days
   - Invest $15-25K in first 90 days for quick wins

3. **Cross-Functional Collaboration**

   - Marketing (Nicole) + E-commerce (Alejandro) weekly sync
   - Product team (Laura/Daniel) provides 90-day pipeline visibility
   - Museum team supports shop integration on website
   - Everyone rallies around product launches

4. **Data-Driven Decision Making**

   - Weekly performance reviews (not just looking at dashboards)
   - Monthly deep-dives into attribution and customer journey
   - Quarterly strategic pivots based on learnings
   - Kill what's not working, double down on what is

5. **Speed of Execution**
   - Move fast on quick wins (Google Ads restructure, museum integration)
   - Don't let perfection block progress (launch, learn, iterate)
   - Empower team to make decisions without excessive approvals
   - Test small, scale fast when proven

### What Could Go Wrong

**Risk: Organizational Resistance**

- _"We don't want to dilute the brand on Etsy"_
- _"TikTok isn't our demographic"_
- _"We need to focus on in-store experience"_
- **Mitigation**: Pilot programs with clear success metrics, data-driven discussions, show competitive examples

**Risk: Resource Constraints**

- Budget cuts due to museum performance
- Can't hire needed team members
- Product inventory limitations
- **Mitigation**: Start with lowest-cost initiatives (content, organic social), prove ROI before scaling, phase hiring

**Risk: Execution Failure**

- VA team doesn't work out
- Campaigns don't convert
- New hires underperform
- **Mitigation**: Close management, clear SOPs, performance metrics, fail fast and adjust

**Risk: External Factors**

- Tariffs increase product costs further
- More suppliers close or restrict sales
- Platform algorithm changes hurt organic reach
- **Mitigation**: Diversify suppliers, multichannel strategy, own the email list

**Risk: Burnout**

- Alejandro overwhelmed during transition
- Team fatigue from rapid change
- Quality suffers from rushing
- **Mitigation**: Realistic timelines, delegate aggressively, celebrate small wins, maintain work-life balance

## 12. CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Executive Summary for Leadership

**Current State**: Wynwood Walls Shop has world-class assets (brand, domain authority, products, foot traffic) but is underperforming online due to organizational structure, resource constraints, and fragmented strategy. Current online revenue estimated at $370-470K annually with break-even or slight loss economics.

**Root Cause**: E-commerce director spread across 4 websites with no support team. Marketing and e-commerce operate in silos. Products designed for retail being sold online. No standardized processes for launches or campaigns.

**Opportunity**: With focused execution, the shop can reach $860K-$1.175M in online sales within 12 months and $2-2.6M within 24 months. This requires investment of $45-75K over 12 months and building a proper e-commerce team.

**Critical Path**:

1. **Month 1**: Free up Alejandro, hire VA team, restructure Google Ads, integrate museum-shop
2. **Month 2-3**: Launch Etsy, overhaul email, ramp content, fix website conversion
3. **Month 4-6**: Hire marketing manager, scale what works, launch subscriptions and loyalty
4. **Month 7-12**: Execute seasonal peaks (holidays, Art Basel), mature operations, hit revenue targets

**Investment Required**: $45-75K over 12 months
**Expected Return**: $400-700K revenue increase (3-5X ROI)
**Net Benefit**: $35-85K after investment, plus sustainable growth platform

**Decision Point**: Commit to building proper e-commerce operation, or accept current state as ceiling. Half measures will not work—this requires either full commitment or explicit choice to remain small.

2. **Organizational Structure**: Free Alejandro to focus on shop revenue

   - **Current**: One person manages 4+ websites across all properties

## 13. FINAL THOUGHTS

### The Opportunity

Wynwood Walls has everything needed to build a multi-million dollar online shop:

- **Brand**: World-renowned street art destination
- **Products**: Unique, artist-designed collectibles
- **Traffic**: 250K website visitors + 3M local residents + tourism
- **Team**: Talented individuals who care deeply
- **Infrastructure**: Technical foundations in place

**What's missing**: Coordination, resources, and execution.

### The Gap

The current state can be summarized as:

> "A Formula 1 race car (the assets) driven by one person who's also the mechanic, the pit crew, the strategist, and the team manager—while simultaneously maintaining three other cars."

No matter how talented, one person cannot scale a modern e-commerce business to its potential.

### The Path Forward

Success requires three commitments:

1. **Organizational**: Structure the team for success (free Alejandro, hire support, create collaboration)

2. **Financial**: Invest $45-75K over 12 months for 3-5X return

3. **Strategic**: Embrace multichannel, content-first, customer-centric approach

### The Alternative

Without these changes, expect:

- Continued revenue plateau or slow decline
- Alejandro burnout and potential departure
- Missed opportunities (Art Basel, holidays, artist launches)
- Competitors capturing market share
- Increasing gap between potential and reality

### The Choice

This is a "go big or stay small" moment. There's no middle path of minor tweaks that yields major results. Leadership must decide:

**Option A: Full Commitment**

- Invest in team, tools, and strategy
- Accept 6-12 month ramp time
- Trust the data and process
- Expected outcome: $2-2.6M online revenue within 24 months

**Option B: Maintain Status Quo**

- Accept shop as break-even marketing channel
- Focus resources on museum/gallery/events
- Reduce online ambitions
- Expected outcome: Stable ~$400K annually

**Option C: Exit E-Commerce**

- Close online shop entirely
- Focus 100% on in-person sales
- Eliminate e-commerce costs
- Expected outcome: Reduce complexity, lose growth opportunity

**Recommendation**: Option A with clear metrics and decision points. Pilot for 90 days, measure results, then commit or pivot.

## Closing Statement

This analysis represents a comprehensive assessment of Wynwood Walls' e-commerce operations based on three hours of meeting transcripts. The findings are clear:

**The assets are world-class. The execution is fragmented. The opportunity is substantial.**

With focused investment ($45-75K over 12 months), organizational restructuring (proper team and clear roles), and disciplined execution (following the roadmap), Wynwood Walls Shop can grow from ~$400K to $2-2.6M in online revenue within 24 months.

The choice is simple: **Commit fully or accept the status quo.**

Half measures—small budget increases, minor tweaks, hope without strategy—will not bridge this gap. This business needs a proper e-commerce operation or it needs to explicitly choose to remain a supplementary sales channel.

The good news: Everything required for success is already present. The brand, products, traffic, and talent exist. What's missing is structure, resources, and coordination. These are solvable problems with known solutions.

**The time to decide is now. The opportunity window is open. The path forward is clear.**
